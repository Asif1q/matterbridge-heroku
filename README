# Matterbridge-heroku

![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg)](https://heroku.com/deploy)

This inline buildpack downloads and installs matterbridge, and lets you connect an irc channel to a Mattermost channel.

This is a work in progress. I'd like it to eventually support an arbitrary number of bridges and services, but IRC only is a fine MVP for now.
